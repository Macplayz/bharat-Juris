# Bharat Juris

**Bharat Juris** is a next-generation AI legal assistant designed to bridge the gap between complex Indian laws and the common citizen. Built with **Next.js** and **Llama-3 (via Groq)**, it acts as a virtual legal companion that democratizes access to justice.

Legal literacy in India is low, and professional legal advice is expensive. Bharat Juris solves this by providing instant, accurate, and simplified explanations of the **Constitution of India**, **Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS)**, and the **Indian Penal Code (IPC)**. Whether you are a law student, a citizen seeking rights awareness, or someone confused by legal jargon, Bharat Juris is here to help.

## Why Bharat Juris? (Beyond Standard RAG)

Unlike typical **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** chatbots that simply fetch and stitch database snippets, Bharat Juris utilizes a **Multi-Model Inference Engine** powered by **Groq**.

| **Response Quality** | "Stitches" random paragraphs together | **Synthesizes** legal intent like a human expert |
| **Context** | Struggles with vague queries | Understands **situational context** & nuance |
| **Reliability** | Prone to retrieval errors | **Contextually Fluent** & consistent |
